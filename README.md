## About me
I am in pursuit of an education as frontend-developer at <a href="https://www.noroff.no/" target="_blank">Noroff Education</a>. I like to create and breathe life into creations others have designed or something I personally have designed myself.

In my freetime I like to play videogames, watch YouTube videos about frogs, solo camping and any videogame related videos, and the occasional play-around in VS code with any APIs I find interesting.

### Some of my live projects from Noroff:
[Techomaze](https://technomaze.netlify.app/)

[Square Eyes ](https://firkantoyne.netlify.app/)

[Science Museum](https://oslosm.netlify.app/)
